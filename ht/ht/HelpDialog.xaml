Players&#10;will take turns in placing their black and white pieces on the board.&#10;When nine pieces of each color have been placed, each may be&#10;moved to any vacant slots which connect to the piece's current location&#10;with a line. When a player places or moves their piece so that they create&#10;a horizontal or vertical line of three, they achieve a mill and may remove&#10;one of their opponent's pieces from the board that is not a part of a mill.&#10;Should all of their pieces be a part of a mill any piece may be removed.&#10;The player who leaves their opponent with less than two remaining pieces&#10;is the victor. If a player has less than three remaining pieces, they may&#10;move them to any vacant slot on the board on their turn. Good luck!"/>
